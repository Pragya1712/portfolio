         <h3>About Me</h3>
         <p>Hi, I'm Pragya Kumar, a passionate B.Tech CSE student at Eternal University, Himachal Pradesh. Born and raised in Delhi, I completed my schooling at Kendriya Vidyalaya Tagore Garden. My love for coding drove me to pursue this degree, as I thrive on solving problems and exploring new technologies. Beyond academics, I have a creative sideâ€”I enjoy dancing, singing, arts and crafts, and am an avid cricket fan. Traveling excites me, as I love discovering new places and experiences. I take pride in delivering high-quality work with precision and always keep things up to date. With a natural curiosity and a strong sense of responsibility, I am eager to learn, grow, and secure a reputed job in the coming year.</p>
